SIMPLIFY-BKG

Context-free grammar simplifier

This program simplifies given context-free grammar. Source code can be compiled by Makefile:
	$ make

Program can be then executed this way:
	$ ./simplify-bkg parameters [input]
where input is the path to the input file and parameters is one of the following:
	-i ... 	Validates the grammar from the input and prints exactly the same grammar.
	-1 ... 	Returns context-free grammar as the result of the first part of Algorithm 4.3.
	-2 ... 	Returns context-free grammar without useless symbols.

If the path is not specified, the program reads from standard input.

The format of input grammar is following:
	<list of nonterminals>\n
	<list of terminals>\n
	<start symbol>\n
	<rule 1>\n
		.
		.
		.
	<rule n>\n
where the list of nonterminals is the list of upper-cased letters separated by commas. The list
if nonterminals is the list of lower-cased letters separated by commas. Rules have the following 
format: A->x, where x is the combination of nonterminals and terminals or # (the epsilon rule).

The output of the program prints the grammar of the same format, as is the input. Order of nonterminals 
and terminals may differ from the input grammar - in result grammar these sets are sorted in 
alphabetical order.
